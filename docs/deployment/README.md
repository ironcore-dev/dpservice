# Dataplane Service deployment
This repository only provides a compiled binary of `dp_service`. To properly use it, you need to use the provided Docker file to generate an image and run it using the [metalnet project](https://github.com/onmetal/metalnet).

All command-line arguments and configuration files are already handled by the Docker image.

For development, direct use of dp-service is covered by the [development section](../development/).
